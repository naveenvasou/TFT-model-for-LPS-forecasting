# TFT-model-for-LPS-forecasting
Forecasting the intensity and position of Monsoon Low-Pressure Systems using a Temporal Fusion Transformer trained on ERA5 data and LPS tracks. Achieves accurate 5-day forecasts with interpretable deep learning, outperforming traditional NWP models.

This repository contains the codebase and experimental pipeline for forecasting the intensity and position of Monsoon Low-Pressure Systems (LPS) over the Indian subcontinent using an interpretable deep learning model — the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT).

Using a combination of ERA5 reanalysis data and a curated LPS track dataset (1979–2019), this project demonstrates how deep learning can outperform traditional numerical weather prediction (NWP) models in both accuracy and computational efficiency.
